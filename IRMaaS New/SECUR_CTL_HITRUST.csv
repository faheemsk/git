","Access control rules shall account for and reflect the organization's policies for information dissemination and authorization, and these rules shall be supported
by formal procedures and clear1y defined responsibilities. Access control rules and rights for each user or group of users shall be clearly stated. Access controls are both logical and physical and these shall be considered together. Users and service providers shall be given a clear statement of the business requirements to be met by access controls.

Specifically, the access control program shall take account of the following:

1. security requirements of individual business applications;
2. information dissemination and authorization (e.g., need-to-know, need to share, and least privilege principles; security levels; and classification of information.)
3. relevant isolation and  contractual obligations reaardina orotection of access to data or services;
4. standard user access profiles for common job roles in the organization;
5. requirements for formal authorization of access requests;
6. requirements for emergency access;
7. requirements for periodic review of access controls; and
8. removal of access rights.

The organization shall develop and disseminate/communicate a formal access control program (e.g., through policies and procedures) and review and update the program annually.
All information related to the business applications and the risks the information is facing shall be identified. The access control and information classification policies of different systems and networks shall be consistent.
Access rights shall be managed in a distributed and networked environment ensuring all types of connections available are recognized. Access control roles (e.g., access request, access authorization, access administration) shall be segregated.

Account types shall be identified (individual, shared/group, system, application, guest/anonymous, emergency and temporary) and conditions for group and role membership shall be established.

Access to the information systems shall be granted based on a valid need-to­ know/need-to-share that is determined by assigned official duties and intended system usage. Such usage/access shall be granular enough to support patient (e.g., ePHI) or participant (e.g., PMI) consent (see CSF controls 06.d, 13.b thru 13.g) that has been captured by the PMI organization and should limit access, use, or disclosure based on what is necessary to satisfy a particular purpose or carry out a function. Access granted shall satisfy all personnel security criteria. Proper identification shall be required for requests to establish information system accounts and approval of all such requests. Guest/anonymous, shared/group, emergency and temporary accounts shall be specifically authorized and use monitored. Unnecessary accounts shall be removed, disabled or otherwise secured. Account managers shall be notified when users are terminated or transferred, their information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes, or when accounts (including shared/group, emergency, and temporary
accounts) are no longer required. Shared/arouo account credentials shall be modified when users are removed from the group.

The access control procedure for user registration and de-registration shall:
1. communicate password procedures and policies to all users who have system access
2. check that the user has authorization from the system owner for the use of the information system or service;
3. separate approval for access rights from management;
4. check that the level of access granted is appropriate to the business purpose and is consistent with organizational security policy (e.g., it is consistent with sensitivity and risks associated with the information and/or information system, it does not compromise segregation of duties);
5. give users a written statement of their access rights;
6. require users to sign statements indicating that they understand the conditions of access;
7. ensure service providers do not provide access until authorization procedures have been completed;
8. ensure default accounts are removed and/or renamed;
9. maintain a formal record of all persons registered to use the service;
10. remove or block critical access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs or left the organization immediately and remove or block non-critical access within 24 hours; and
11. automatically remove or disable accounts that have been inactive for a period of sixty (60) days or more.
The organization shall require that the registration process to receive hardware administrative tokens and credentials used for two (2)-factor authentication be verified in person before a designated registration authority with authorization by a designated organizational official (e.g., a supervisor or other individual defined in an applicable security plan).

Organizations shall not use group, shared or generic accounts and passwords.

The organization shall employ automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.

In addition to assigning a unique ID and password, at least one of the following methods shall be employed to authenticate all users:

1. token devices (e.g., SecurelD, certificates, or public key); or
2. biometrics.
The organization shall automatically disable emergency accounts within twenty­ four (24) hours and temporary accounts with a fixed duration not to exceed thirty (30) days.

Special attention shall be given to the allocation of privileged access rights, which allow users to override system controls.","The allocation of privileges for all systems and system components shall be controlled through a formal authorization process. The access privileges
associated with each system product (e.g., operating system, database management system and each application) and the users to which they need to
be allocated shall be identified. Privileges shall be allocated to users on a need-lo­ use basis and on an event-by-event basis in line with the access control policy
(i.e. the minimum requirement for their functional role, e.g., user or administrator, only when needed).

At a minimum, the organization explicitly authorizes access to the following list of security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security­ relevant information:

1. Setting/modifying audit logs and auditing behavior;
2. Setting/modifying boundary protection system rules;
3. Configuring/modifying access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges);
4. Setting/modifying authentication parameters; and
5. Setting/modifying system configurations and parameters.

An authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated shall be maintained.

Role-based access control shall be implemented and capable of mapping each user to one or more roles, and each role to one or more system functions.

The development and use of system routines shall be promoted to avoid the need to grant privileges to users. The development and use of programs which avoid the need to run with elevated privileges shall be promoted.

Elevated privileges shall be assigned to a different user ID from those used for normal business use. All users shall access privileged services in a single role (users registered with more than one role shall designate a single role during each system access session). The use of system administration privileges (any feature
or facility of an information system that enables the user to override system or
application controls) shall be minimized. Access to privileged functions (e.g., system-level software, administrator tools, scripts, utilities) deployed in hardware, software, and firmware shall be restricted. Security relevant information shall be restricted to explicitly authorized individuals.
The organization shall facilitate information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access authorizations assigned to business partners match the access restrictions on information for specific circumstances in which user discretion is allowed. Also employs manual processes or automated mechanisms to assist users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions.

The access control system for the system components storing, processing or transmitting covered information shall be set with a default ""deny-all"" setting.
The organization shall limit authorization to privileged accounts on information systems to a pre-defined subset of users and shall track and monitor privileged role assignments for anomalous behavior. The organization shall audit the execution of privileged functions on information systems and ensure information systems prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards (e.g., IDS/IPS or malicious code protection mechanisms).

All file system access not explicitly required for system, application, and administrator functionality shall be disabled.

Access to all hypervisor management functions or administrative consoles for systems hosting virtualized systems shall be restricted to personnel based upon the principle of least privilege and supported through technical controls (e.g., two­ factor authentication, audit trails, IP address filtering, firewalls, and TLS encapsulated communications to the administrative consoles).

Contractors shall be provided with minimal system and physical access, and shall agree to and support the organization's security requirements. The contractor selection process shall assess the contractor's ability to adhere to and support the organization's security policy and procedures.

The organization ensure only authorized users are permitted to access those files, directories, drives, workstations, servers, network shares, ports, protocols, and services that are expressly required for the performance of the users' job duties.

Authentication and authorization mechanisms shall be applied for users and equipment.,"The organization shall specify the networks and network services to which users are authorized access.
The organization shall:

1. determine who is allowed to access which network and networked services (see 01.i, level 1); and
2. specify the means that can be used to access networks and network services (e.g., the conditions for allowing access to a remote system). At a minimum, the organization manages all enterprise devices remotely
logging into the internal network, with remote control of their configuration, installed software, and patch levels. The organization shall also publish minimum security standards for access to the enterprise network by third­ party devices (e.g., subcontractors/vendors), and perform a security scan before allowing access.

iii. privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports) shall be identified as external information systems.
2. authorized individuals shall be prohibited from using an external information system to access the information system or to process, store or transmit organization-controlled information except in situations where the organization:
i. can verify the employment of required security controls on the external system as specified in the organizations information security policy and system security plan; or
ii. has approved information system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external information system.

1. a cryptographic based technique;
2. biometric techniques;
3. hardware tokens;
4. software tokens;
5. a challenge/response protocol; or
6. certificate agents.

The organization shall protect wireless access to systems containing sensitive information by authenticating users and devices.

Remote access to business information across public networks shall only take place after successful identification and authentication. Remote access by vendors and business partners (e.g., maintenance, reports or other data access) shall be disabled unless specifically authorized by management. If remote maintenance is performed, the organization shall closely monitor and control any activities, with immediate deactivation after use. Remote access to business partner accounts shall also be immediately deactivated after use.

Use Radius or Kerberos to enable user privilege/resources to access the organization's network. For dial-up connections, use CHAP negotiation for encryption of user authentication. Configure CHAP instead of PAP for user authentication in dialup connection for encryption and security. If encryption is not used for dial-up connections, the CIO or his/her designated representative must provide specific written authorization.
Authentication of remote users shall be implemented via virtual private network (VPN) solutions that support a cryptographic based technique, hardware tokens, or a challenge/response protocol. Dedicated private lines may also be used to provide assurance of the source of connections. Control all remote access through a limited number of managed access control points.

Periodic monitoring shall be implemented to ensure that installed equipment does not include unanticipated dial-up capabilities. Require callback capability with re­ authentication to verify connections from authorized locations. For application systems and turnkey systems that require the vendor to log-on, the vendor shall be assigned a User ID and password and enter the network through the standard authentication process. Access to such systems shall be authorized and logged. User IDs assigned to vendors will be reviewed in accordance with the organization's access review policy, at a minimum annually.

Node authentication may serve as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users where they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility. Cryptographic techniques (e.g., based on machine certificates) can be used for node authentication. This is part of several VPN based solutions.
The organization requires all remote login access (including VPN, dial-up, and other forms of access that allow login to internal systems, e.g., from an alternate work location or to sensitive information via a Web portal) to use two-factor authentication
The information system monitors and controls remote access methods.

The execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access shall only be authorized for compelling operational needs and rationale documented.

An internal network perimeter shall be implemented by installing a secure gateway (e.g., a firewall) between two interconnected networks to control access and information flow between the two domains. This gateway shall be capable of enforcing security policies, be configured to filter traffic between these domains, and block unauthorized access in accordance with the organization's access control policy.

Wireless networks shall be segregated from internal and private networks.

The organization shall require a firewall between any wireless network and the covered information systems environment.

The criteria for segregation of networks into domains shall be based on the access control policy and access requirements, and also takes account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology. In addition, segregation of networks shall be based on the value and classification of information stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption.

Networks shall be divided into separate logical network domains (e.g., an organization's internal network domains and external network domains) each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls shall be applied in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments (e.g., publicly accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets).

Segregations of separate logical domains shall be achieved by restricting network access using virtual private networks for user groups within the organization.
Networks shall also be segregated using network device functional ity (e.g., IP switching).

A baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems shall be established and managed. Separate domains shall then be implanted by controlling the network data flows using routing/switching capabilities, including access control lists, according to applicable flow control policies.

The domains shall be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.

The organization shall implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks. To ensure proper separation, the organization verifies any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network. and if it is not required for business purposes, moves it to an internal VLAN and gives it a private address.

Organizations shall use a network segregated from production-level networks when migrating physical servers, applications or data to virtualized servers.

The organization manages the network infrastructure across network connections that are separated from the business use of that network, relying on separate VLANs or, preferably, on entirely different physical connectivity for management sessions for network devices

Users shall be uniquely identified and authenticated for both local and remote accesses to information systems using a username and password (see 01.d) at a minimum or preferably a username and password supplemented or replaced by risk-based (non-static) and/or strong authentication methods. Access to PMI data and any other data deemed extremely sensitive (e.g., by statute) is considered privileged and requires multi-factor authentication. The requirement for risk-based, strong and multi-factor authentication methods shall be determined by the organizations risk assessment and its application commensurate with the type of data, level of sensitivity of the information, and user type.

Appropriate authentication methods including strong authentication methods in addition to passwords shall be used for communicating through an external, non­ organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet).

Help desk support shall require user identification for any transaction that has information security implications.

Sensitive authentication data shall not be stored after authorization {even if encrypted).

During the registration process to provide new or replacement hardware tokens in-person verification shall be required in front of a designated registration authority with authorization by a designated organizational official (e.g., a supervisor).

The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy minimum token requirements discussed in NIST SP 800- 63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline.

When PKl-based authentication is used, the information system: validates certificates by constructing a certification path with status information to an accepted trust anchor;

1. validates certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information;
2. enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
3. maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
4. implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of an inability to access revocation information via the network.

The information system shall use replay-resistant authentication mechanisms
such as nonce, one-time passwords, or time stamps (e.g., Kerberos, TLS, etc.) for network access to privileged accounts.

The organization requires access for all accounts, including those for network and security devices, to be obtained through a centralized point of authentication, for example Active Directory or LDAP.

The organization shall employ multifactor authentication for remote network access to privileged and non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access. The organization shall employ multifactor authentication for local access to privileged accounts (including those used for non-local maintenance and diagnostic sessions).

Where multi-factor authentication is not supported for these use cases, users shall be required to use long passwords on the system of at least 14 characters.

Risk assessments shall be consistent and identify information security risks to the organization. The organization shall account for risks from sources including prior incidents experienced, changes in the environment (e.g., new methods of attack, new sources of attack, new vulnerabilities), and any supervisory guidance (e.g., third party consultancy).

They may be quantitative, semi- or quasi-quantitative, or qualitative but shall be consistent and comparable, so the prioritization of resources to manage risk can be performed. Risk assessments are to be performed at planned intervals, or when major changes occur in the environment, and the results reviewed annually.

Risk assessments (analysis) used to determine whether a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHl)as these terms are defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is reportable to the Secretary must demonstrate there is a low probability of compromise (lo pro co) rather than a significant risk of harm. The methodology shall, at a minimum, address the following factors:
1. the nature of the PHI involved, including the types of identifiers involved and the likelihood of re-identification;
2. the unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made;
3. whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed·
4. the extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated; and
5. and other factors/guidance promulgated by the Secretary.

The organization shall update the results of a comprehensive risk assessment every two (2) years, or whenever there is a significant change to the information system or operational environment, assesses a subset of the security controls within every 365 days during continuous monitoring, and reviews the risk assessment results annually.

The organization shall employ assessors or assessment teams with an organization-defined level of independence to conduct security control assessments and ensure impartiality of the results.

A formal, documented process shall be in place for identifying risks and performing risk assessments, and communicating the results of the risk assessments to the affected parties, and to management. A repository and tracking system shall be in place to manage risk assessments performed.

The likelihood and magnitude of harm from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits shall be included in the risk assessment process. The likelihood and impact associated with inherent and residual risk should be determined independently, considering all risk categories (e.g., audit results, threat and vulnerability analysis, and regulatory compliance).

Information security risk assessments shall require knowledge of the following:
1. external environment factors that could exacerbate or moderate any or all of the levels of the risk components described previously;
2. the types of accounts offered by the organization;
3. the methods the organization provides to open and access its accounts;
4. knowledge and experiences of incident histories and actual case impact scenarios; and
5. systems  architectures.

1. Avoidance - This approach eliminates the risk by avoidance of the activity which provides the risk. For example, the risk associated with utilization of wireless technologies can be mitigated by deciding not to use wireless technologies at all.
2. Reduction - Risk can be reduced by way of controls that can reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. An example would be encryption of network traffic to minimize risks that threaten the confidentiality of data.
3. Transference - Risk can be reduced by shifting it to an outside entity. An example would be the purchase of insurance against fire damage.
4. Acceptance - Organizations can choose to accept risk by not selecting any of the aforementioned approaches. When acceptance is selected, management acceptance must be documented.

Organizations shall define and document the criteria to determine whether or not a risk shall be avoided, accepted, transferred or treated.

The factors to be taken into account shall include the following:

1. industry sector, industry or organizational laws, regulations and standards;
2. clinical or other priorities (in the case of health related organizations);
3. cultural fit;

9. number of threats covered;
10. risk level at which the controls become justified;
11. risk level that led to the recommendation being made;
12. alternatives already in place; and
13. additional benefits derived.

The organization implements a process for ensuring that corrective action plans for the security program and the associated organizational information systems are prioritized and maintained; and the remedial information security actions
necessary to mitigate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, and other organizations are documented.

The organization shall review corrective action plans (plans of action and milestones) for consistency with the organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.

A current network diagram (for example, one that shows how covered information flows over the network) shall exist, documenting all connections to systems storing, processing or transmitting covered information, including any wireless networks. Network architecture diagrams shall clearly identify high-risk environments and data flows that may have legal compliance impacts. Review
and update the network diagram as based on the changes in the environment and no less than every 6 months.

Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols can be continued targets of malicious individuals who exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to covered information environments. The organization monitors for all authorized and unauthorized wireless access to the information system and prohibits installation of wireless access points (WAP) unless explicitly authorized, in writing, by the CIO or his/her designated representative. If wireless access is explicitly approved, wireless access points and devices shall have appropriate (e.g., FIPS-approved; minimum of AES WPA2) encryption enabled for authentication and transmission.

WAPs shall be placed in secure areas.

The organization shall uniquely identify and authenticate network devices that require authentication mechanisms before establishing a connection that, at a minimum, use shared information (i.e., MAC or IP address) and access control lists to control remote network access.

To identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks, including wireless networks, the information system shall use either:

1. shared known information solutions (Media Access Control (MAC) or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses); or
2. an organizational authentication solution (IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication).

The required strength of the device authentication mechanism shall be determined by the security categorization of the information system.

A formal process shall be established for approving and testing all network connections and changes to firewall, router, and switch configurations. Any deviations from the standard configuration or updates to the standard
configuration should be documented and approved in a change control system. All new configuration rules beyond a baseline-hardened configuration that allow
traffic to flow through network security devices, such as firewalls and network­
based IPS, should also be documented and recorded, with a specific business reason for each change, a specific individuals name responsible for that business need, and an expected duration of the need. The organization shall build a firewall configuration that restricts connections between un-trusted networks and any
system components in the covered information environment <Note: An ""un-trusted network"" is any network that is external to the networks belonging to the entity under review, and/or which is out of the entity's ability to control or manage.) Any changes to the firewall configuration shall be updated in the network diagram.

The firewall configuration shall:

1. restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the covered information systems environment;
2. secure and synchronize router configuration files;
3. require firewalls between any wireless networks and the covered information systems environment; and
4. configure these firewalls to deny or control any traffic from a wireless environment into the covered data environment.

The organization shall ensure information systems protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information, including during preparation for transmission and during reception. The organization requires information systems to use FIPS­ validated cryptographic mechanisms during transmission to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and detect changes to information unless otherwise protected by organization-defined alternative physical measures.

Organizations shall use secured and encrypted communication channels when migrating physical servers, applications or data to virtualized servers.

Usage restrictions and implementation guidance shall be defined and documented for VoIP, including the authorization and monitoring of the service.

4. applies a default-deny  rule that drops all traffic via host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on its endpoints (workstations, servers, etc.), except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed.

An analysis shall be conducted to determine the impact the loss of network service availability will have upon critical business functions.

Technical controls shall be implemented to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of covered information passing over the organization's network and to/from public networks. Technical tools and solutions shall be implemented and used to identify the vulnerabilities and mitigate the threats, including intrusion detection system (IDS) and/or intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and vulnerability scanning. The organization shall employ tools and techniques, such as an IDS and IPS, to monitor events on the information system, detect and respond to attacks, and provide identification of unauthorized use of the system. These tools shall be implemented at the perimeter of the organization's environment and at key points within the environment, including IDS and IPS deployed on the wireless side of the firewall (WIDS) to identify rogue wireless devices, monitor all traffic to and from the wireless segment, and detect attack attempts and successful compromises. These tools shall be updated on a regular basis, including the engines, the baselines and signatures.

Management processes shall be implemented to ensure coordination of and consistency in the elements of the network infrastructure.

The organization shall establish firewall and router configuration standards for the current network with all connections to covered information, including any wireless networks. A description shall be documented of groups, roles, and responsibilities for the logical management of network components.

Documentation and business justification shall be provided for the use of all services, protocols, and ports allowed, including documentation of security features implemented for those protocols considered to be insecure. The firewall and router rule sets shall be reviewed at least every six months.

Wireless access points shall be shut down when not in use (e.g., nights, weekends). MAC address authentication and static IP addresses shall be utilized. Access points shall be placed in secure areas. File sharing shall be disabled on all wireless clients.

The organization shall build a firewall configuration to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the covered data environment (e.g., information flooding types of denial of service attacks). The router configuration files shall be secured and synchronized. Access to all proxies shall be denied, except for those hosts, ports, and services that are explicitly required. The organization shall utilize firewalls from at least two (2) different vendors at the various levels within the network to reduce the possibility of compromising the entire network.

The organization shall prohibit direct  public access between the Internet and any system component in the covered data environment. This shall be achieved by performing the following:
1. establishing DMZ to limit inbound and outbound traffic to only protocols that are necessary for the covered data environment;
2. limiting inbound Internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ;
3. not allowing any direct routes inbound or outbound for traffic between the Internet and the covered data environment;
4. not allowing internal addresses to pass from the Internet into the DMZ;
5. restricting outbound traffic from the covered data environment to the Internet such that outbound traffic can only access IP addresses within the DMZ;
6. implementing stateful inspection, also known as dynamic packet filtering (that is, only ""established"" connections are allowed into the network);
7. placing all database(s), servers and other system components storing or processing covered information in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ; and
8. methods including but not limited to Network Address Translation (NAT),
placing system components behind a proxy server, and/or removing or filtering route advertisements.
To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there shall be at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. These servers shall be located on different subnets and geographically separated. Authoritative DNS servers shall be segregated into internal and external roles. The DNS server with the internal role shall provide name/address resolution information pertaining to both internal and external information technology resources while the DNS server with the external role shall only provide name/address resolution information pertaining to external information technology resources.

The covered entity provides individuals with an appropriate notice of the potential uses and disclosures of their PHI that contains required elements (e.g., header, descriptions of uses with at least one example, requirements for authorization).

The covered entity must provide appropriate notice, in the manner and timeframe required (via mail, email, website posting) by federal and state law.

If the covered entity provides a health plan, the covered entity provides notice or notices relevant to the individual(other than an inmate) no later than the compliance date or upon enrollment thereafter, within 60 days of a material revision, and no less than every three years.
A covered entity may provide the notice of privacy practices to an individual by e­ mail, if the individual agrees to electronic notice and such agreement has not been withdrawn.

When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations shall ensure, in consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel, that there is a close link between the general authorization and any specific collection of personally identifiable information (Pll). Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements provided at the time of collection (e.g.on forms organizations use to collect Pll).

The organization provides real-time and/or layered notice when it collects Pll. The organization:
1.   publishes System of Records Notices (SORNs) in the Federal Register subject to required oversight processes, for systems containing Pll;
2.   keeps SORNs current; and
3.  includes Privacy Act Statements on its forms that collect Pll, or on separate forms that can be retained by individuals, to provide additional formal notice to individuals from whom the information is being collected.

The organization publishes SORNs on its public website.
